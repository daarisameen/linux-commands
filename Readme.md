## ABOUT REPO
This repo consists of questions in increasing difficulty from two categories namely *PPA* and *GRPA*

Here,
- PPA - stands for Practice Problem Answers
- GRPA - stands for Graded Problem Answers
- LEVEL - ask 5 year old to know what is meaning of Level
- LEVEL *i* - a harder level than LEVEL *i-1*

## AUTHOR ADVICE
This repo consists of only boring questions, I advice you to solve problem in increasing order of levels.

If you are gonna solve LEVEL *i*, solve the LEVEL *i* problems from *PPA* first then move to *GRPA*.

Order of solving:
<ol>
<li> LEVEL 1 of PPA, then LEVEL 1 of GRPA
<li> LEVEL 2 of PPA, then LEVEL 2 of GRPA
<li> LEVEL 3 of PPA, then LEVEL 3 of GRPA, so on ...
</ol>
