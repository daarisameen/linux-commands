Print the number of lines present in ‘file1’ and ‘file2’ combined, your solution should not print anything else. ‘file1’ and ‘file2’ are located in the current working directory.

Hint: Multiple files can be given as argument to ‘cat’ command.

<pre>
script() { 
<b>cat file1 file2 | wc -l</b>

# OR
# cat file2 >> file1; wc -l file1

# OR
# cat file2 >> file1; cat file1 | wc -l
}
</pre>
